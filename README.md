### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ME
Hello, my name is **Valentin**. I live in Villeurbanne in France. It is a city right next to Lyon. I like video game :video_game:, bike :bike:, and music :headphones:.

## HISTORY
I started coding at the end of 2014 with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). I discovered this amazing tool when I was reading an old magazine ([Science et Vie Junior](https://science-et-vie-junior.fr/)) in my school. Then I discovered [**Batch**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bat) and [**Visual Basic Script**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript) with YouTube tutorial. I made a few programs, and it was amazing because I just wrote text in the basic Windows notepad, registered at .vbs or .bat, corrected some bugs and it was working in all Windows PC. I even made a program for a math assignment.

I discovered Discord in February 2017 through a friend. I created my first Discord Bot with the help of YouTube tutorial in October 2017 and at the end of the year I created my GitHub account. I register on [Open Classroom](https://openclassrooms.com/), and I immediately started to learn [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and few days later [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). It was impressive because I created website with graphics and not just text.

By creating Discord bots, I learned JavaScript but client side with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), I learned to use an API with [Discord JS](https://discord.js.org/) and I also learned how to manage a Database with [**SQL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) thanks to a Node.js module.

A few months before my second year in High school (2019-2020) I learned [**Python**](https://www.python.org/). It was useful because I have chosen Computer Science as my one-year specialty, and we studied with Python. I got the grade 20/20 (the best) for my bachelor's degree.

During my last year of High School my main Computer project was the Discord bots : [TrinitÃ©](https://github.com/Ardorax/Trinite) that I made for the server of the High School. This bot created profile for the students with their languages, specialty, project for the futureâ€¦ It was also this year that I joined Epitech, my computer science school.
